Hello World,

I’m Gale.  I’m a daughter, a sister, a fiance, a dog mom, and a nurse. Most recently, though, the title that has most heavily defined my life is nurse. 

I’ve been stuck in the trenches of pandemic nursing for the last 18 months. For quite a while, the weight of being a pandemic nurse left me depleted, angry, and hopeless. Then one day I realized my cup was empty. There was nothing left to pour. I was ready to close the door on nursing entirely. I went to my manager and told her, “I just feel depleted.” Together we came up with a plan to improve my mental and physical health, and after months of hard work, I’ve managed to figure out a thing or two about self-love in nursing and I’m excited to share what I’ve learned with all the other nurses out there that may be struggling right now.

If you’re more of a visual/musical person, head on over to my TikTok for some light-hearted routines, nursing tips, workouts, and healthy recipes.

Thanks for popping in. Until next time,

*Gale*
